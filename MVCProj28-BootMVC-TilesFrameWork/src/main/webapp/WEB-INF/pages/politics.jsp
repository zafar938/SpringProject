<h3 style="color:red">Letter to the 'Eldest', Meeting Over Tea: How Amarinder,
 Sidhu Buried Hatchet After Long-Drawn Cold War</h3>
 <pre>
    After months of political feud and infighting in Punjab Congress, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and  
    Navjot Singh Sidhu made peace as the Captain attended the latter’s swearing-in ceremony as PPCC chief 
    on Friday. The two leaders decided to reconcile over some tea after a long-drawn cold war and a 
    volley of allegations, all out in the open.
    The 57-year-old Amritsar MLA in a letter on Thursday requested the CM to come for the installation 
    ceremony, calling him the “eldest of the Punjab Congress family" and saying he had “no personal
     agenda". Softening his stance, the chief minister invited party MLAs for tea at Punjab Bhawan
      ahead of the installation ceremony at the party headquarters. This is the first time in nearly
       four months that Sidhu and Amarinder Singh met each other.
     As the two leaders decided to bury the hatchet, CM Amarinder Singh urged party workers to
      extend full support to the new state president. “We have to strengthen the Congress party
       in Punjab. I am telling everyone from this stage that we have to support Sidhu and work 
       together for Punjab."
       Ahead of taking charge of the state Congress, Sidhu met the chief minister at Punjab Bhawan.
        In a viral video of Sidhu greeting the chief minister, he was heard saying, “How are you, sir?"
         The chief minister and the Amritsar (East) MLA were seen sitting next to each other at Punjab 
         Bhawan and later at the party headquarters.
