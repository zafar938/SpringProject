<pre>
India vs Sri Lanka 3rd ODI Live Cricket Score Online: Shikhar Dhawan won the toss and elected to bat first.
 India have six changes in the side including five debutants — Sanju Samson, Nitish Rana, Chetan Sakariya,
  Krishnappa Gowtham, Rahul Chahar. The sixth change in Navdeep Saini replacing Bhuvneshwar Kumar. 
  India won the first game comfortably by seven wickets whereas Deepak Chahar pulled off a heist in the 
  second game with his match-winning unbeaten 69 helping visitors win by three wickets.
With the series already in the bag, the team may rest ‘Kulcha’ (Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal) and 
play the young guns, with Krunal as the third spinner. For Sri Lanka, a win in the final game would help
 them gain confidence ahead of the three-match T20I series.
